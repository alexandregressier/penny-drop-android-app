# Penny Drop Android App

## Description

This app replicates the board game "Penny Drop". The goal is simple: get rid of all your pennies first! Turn by turn
each player roll the die and place a penny in one of the 6 slots, corresponding to the number shown on the die. If the
player rolls a number that already has a penny in it, they must take all the pennies present on the board. A player must
take at least one roll, but can pass after that. The slot #6 contains a hole, meaning 6's can be rolled endlessly.
